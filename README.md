# Roboadvisory Software

Creating a roboadvisory software - a software that creates an investment portfolio to the customer based on their risk appetite and predicts the returns you can get through that.  

Working with the head of the Department of Management Studies, IIT Madras and a PhD scholar. Can't share the code as it's still in development stage - expected completion: by Jan '24. 

**Selection of investment portfolio**
The investment porfolio is curated based on various factors of the financial instrument and a novel smart beta factor.

**Return Prediction**
Tried multiple models - ridge, lasso regression, ann, lstm, arima, etc. Finalised on LSTM as it gave the most accurate predictions.
